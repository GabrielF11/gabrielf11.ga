This website uses animate.css, and Bootstrap.

I am currently in the process of trying to add dark mode, but only a couple pages have it as it causes issues with Bootstrap cards.
UPDATE: After a long while of playing around with CSS, I found a way to make it work! The im bored and projects page now have dark mode!
