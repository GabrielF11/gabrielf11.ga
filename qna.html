            <b>Q: How was this website made?</b>
            <p>A: This webpage was made in HTML and CSS by GabrielF11. To make it look better, I used Water.css and
                Animate.css. Also, it's hosted by Github Pages.

            <b>Q: Why is the 404 page shown on a real existing page and is left aligned with weird styling?</b>
            <p>A: It usally happens when you have a / at the very end of the link. if you remove it it should fix it.
                I have no idea why it's happening and I'm too lazy to fix it.
